## What is Fisher's Iris Data Set?

<p>This data set was first introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. For his work in statistics, he has been described as "a genius who almost single-handedly created the foundations for modern statistical science" and "the single most important figure in 20th century statistics". </p>

<p>This data set has 150 objects of 3 different classes and 4 features. The 3 different classes of different species of the North American *Iris* flower (*Iris setosa, I. virginica* and *I. ersicolor* ). It has 50 numeric values for each of the 3 species (in cm); 
1. sepal length 
2. sepal width 
3. petal length 
4. petal width </p>

<p>Because it was one of the first widely available and high profile ‘real data’ sets, it’s use increased hugely as a teaching resource for statistics.  It is very often used today for testing out machine learning and visualizations (for example scatter plots). </p>
